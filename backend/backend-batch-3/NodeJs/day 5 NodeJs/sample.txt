# Node.js Streams - Complete Guide

## What are Streams?

Streams let you process data piece by piece (in chunks) instead of loading everything into memory at once. Think of it like drinking water through a straw vs. drinking the whole glass at once.

**Benefits:**

- Memory efficient (handles large files easily)
- Faster (start processing before all data arrives)
- Better for large files, videos, logs, etc.

## 1. Readable Streams

**Purpose:** Read data from a source (files, HTTP requests, etc.)

### Basic Example:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");
const readStream = fs.createReadStream("./sample.txt", "utf-8");

readStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log("Received chunk:", chunk);
});

readStream.on("end", () => {
  console.log("Finished reading");
});
```

### Creating Custom Readable Stream:

```javascript
const { Readable } = require("stream");

const readableStream = new Readable({
  highWaterMark: 2, // Buffer size (how much data to hold)
  read() {}, // Required method (can be empty)
});

// Push data into stream
readableStream.push("Hello");
readableStream.push("World");
readableStream.push(null); // Signals end of stream

readableStream.on("data", (chunk) => {
  console.log(chunk.toString());
});
